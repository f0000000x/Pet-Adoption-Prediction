# Pet Adoption Prediction

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning tool to predict how fast a pet is adopted so that shelters/adoption agencies can improve their pet profilesâ€™ appeal,  reduce animal suffering and euthanization, and better focus on their resources to help pets to find new homes.
