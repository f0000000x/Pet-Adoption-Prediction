# Pet Adoption Prediction

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning tool to predict how fast a pet is adopted so that shelters/adoption agencies can improve their pet profilesâ€™ appeal,  reduce animal suffering and euthanization, and better focus on their resources to help pets to find new homes.

# Motivation

Since we are unable to make any impact on the total number of stray animals in this project, we hope to use our knowledge to provide animal rescuers with a broader vision and thinking. We hope to help more stray animals in the shelter to find suitable adopters. Or by using deep learning models to predict the popularity of pets at the shelter, giving practitioners some direction, the adoption process can be made more efficient.

# Data Resources

The data was released by petfind.my in Kaggle on December 27, 2018.
