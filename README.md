# Pet Adoption Prediction
[Track our process](https://trello.com/b/XnakVEjv/data-science-capstone-dats-6501siqi-jiang-xi-zhang) </br>
Use machine learning to address the surplus of stray animals so that more animals in the shelter can find adopters, reducing euthanasia. Build user interfaces to raise awareness of stray animals.

# Motivation

Since we are unable to make any impact on the total number of stray animals in this project, we hope to use our knowledge to provide animal rescuers with a broader vision and thinking. We hope to help more stray animals in the shelter to find suitable adopters. Or by using deep learning models to predict the popularity of pets at the shelter, giving practitioners some direction, the adoption process can be made more efficient.

# Goal

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning tool to predict how fast a pet is adopted so that shelters/adoption agencies can improve their pet profilesâ€™ appeal,  reduce animal suffering and euthanization, and better focus on their resources to help pets to find new homes.
