# Pet Adoption Prediction
Use machine learning to address the surplus of stray animals so that more animals in the shelter can find adopters, reducing euthanasia. Build user interfaces to raise awareness of stray animals.

# Motivation

Since we are unable to make any impact on the total number of stray animals in this project, we hope to use our knowledge to provide animal rescuers with a broader vision and thinking. We hope to help more stray animals in the shelter to find suitable adopters. Or by using deep learning models to predict the popularity of pets at the shelter, giving practitioners some direction, the adoption process can be made more efficient.

# Goal

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning tool to predict how fast a pet is adopted so that shelters/adoption agencies can improve their pet profilesâ€™ appeal,  reduce animal suffering and euthanization, and better focus on their resources to help pets to find new homes.

# Data Resources

The data was released by petfind.my in Kaggle on December 27, 2018.

# Model Design(Preliminary)

* Based on the characteristics of stray animals, linear models are used to predict adoption rates and to find ways to increase adoption rates.
* Since cuteness cannot be accurately quantified by a limited set of features, it may be more accurate to use deep learning to process animals images directly.
* Create web pages for data visualization and user interaction. Users can enter animal features or upload images directly to get a prediction of the animal's adoption.
* (Optional)Apply GAN(Generative Adversarial Networks) as a data augmentation tool or struct a demo for entertainment.
